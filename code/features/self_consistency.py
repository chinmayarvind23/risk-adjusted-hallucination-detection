"""
Compute a self-consistency disagreement score from multiple sampled answers.

The current implementation uses sentence embeddings from a sentence-transformer.
It treats the first answer as the served answer and asks how similar each of its
sentences is to the best matching sentence in the other sampled answers.

Higher disagreement means the sampled answers diverge more strongly, which is
used as a proxy for higher hallucination risk.
